# DnD_Library

I have over 300 pdfs for the Dungeons and Dragons tabletop roleplaying. This project is my solution to having to endlessly path through different directories in file explorer. 

Similar to my graduation project I made use of mySQL and PHP for the backend. I'm still working on adding more features to this project but for now it does exactly what I need!
